      Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as
      HTML. It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can also be used for other
      purposes. HTTP follows a classical client-server model, with a client opening a connection to make a request, then
      waiting until it receives a response. HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning that the server does not keep any data
      (state) between two requests.
